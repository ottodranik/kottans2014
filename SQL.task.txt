1. get all statuses, not repeating, alphabetically ordered
SELECT tasks.status as status FROM tasks GROUP BY status ORDER BY status ASC


2. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by tasks count descending
SELECT projects.id, projects.name, count(tasks.id) as task_count FROM projects LEFT JOIN tasks ON tasks.project_id = projects.id GROUP BY projects.id ORDER BY task_count DESC


3. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects names
SELECT projects.id, projects.name, count(tasks.id) as task_count FROM projects LEFT JOIN tasks ON tasks.project_id = projects.id GROUP BY projects.id ORDER BY projects.name


4. get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with 'N' letter
SELECT tasks.*, projects.name as project_name FROM tasks LEFT JOIN projects ON projects.id = tasks.project_id WHERE projects.name LIKE "N%"


5. get the list of all projects containing the 'a' letter in the middle of the name, and show the tasks count near each project. Mention that there can exist projects without tasks and tasks with project_id=NULL
SELECT projects.id, projects.name, count(tasks.id) as task_count FROM projects LEFT JOIN tasks ON tasks.project_id = projects.id WHERE projects.name LIKE "%a%" GROUP BY projects.id ORDER BY task_count DESC


6. get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically
SELECT name, count(*) as count FROM tasks GROUP BY name HAVING count > 1 ORDER BY name ASC


7. get the list of tasks having several exact matches of both name and status, from the project 'Garage'. Order by matches count
SELECT tasks.name, tasks.status, projects.name, count(*) as count FROM tasks LEFT JOIN projects ON projects.id = tasks.project_id WHERE projects.name = "Garage" GROUP BY tasks.name, tasks.status HAVING count > 1 ORDER BY count ASC


8. get the list of project names having more than 10 tasks in status 'completed'. Order by project_id
SELECT projects.*, count(tasks.id) as count FROM projects LEFT JOIN tasks ON projects.id = tasks.project_id WHERE tasks.status = 'completed' GROUP BY projects.name HAVING count > 10 ORDER BY projects.id ASC
